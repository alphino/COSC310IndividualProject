# COSC310IndividualProject
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive conversational agent that responds to user input. The Chatbot will essentially output canned responses to a users input.

**Added API**

I have added the following:

Yahoo! Answers API -aggregate answers from Yahoo! for your own conversation use

Twitter  API -pull  the  latest  tweets  from  a  famous  person,  parse  that  tweet,  and integrate relevant information into yourconversation
